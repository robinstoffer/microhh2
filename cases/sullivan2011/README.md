# Case dry convective boundary layer following Sullivan and Patton (2011)

## Case description
Convective boundary layer with a surface flux of 0.24 K m/s growing into a well mixed layer with a jump and stratification above. Case is described in Sullivan and Patton (2011): *The Effect of Mesh Resolution on Convective Boundary Layer Statistics and Structures Generated by Large-Eddy Simulation, JAS*
