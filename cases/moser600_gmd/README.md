# Channel flow at Re_tau = 600

## Case description
This case runs the channel flow as described in *Moser et al. (1999): Direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flow up to Re_tau = 590, PoF.* Reference data is included against which the results can be plotted using the `moser600_stats.py` script.
