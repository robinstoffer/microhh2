# DNS of dry CBL over a constant temperature surface.
This case contains the case as documented in the paper of *van Heerwaarden and Mellado (2016): Growth and decay of a convective boundary layer over a surface with a constant temperature, JAS.*

Four cases with four different Reynolds numbers are available as documented in the paper.

The default case presented here is a 2D version of the ReS case.
